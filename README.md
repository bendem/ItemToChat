![Preview](http://puu.sh/7m9ii.png)

## Summary

Ever thought it would be neat to have a way to display items in the chat like what you can see
in big MMORPG like World of Warcraft or Guild Wars 2? It's now possible with this plugin.

You can just middle click an item and it will send it to the chat.

## Commands

- ``/itc reload`` : Guess what it does :-)
- ``/itc send <player> <item>`` : Sends an item to a player trough the chat
(when he click it, the item is taken from you inventory is put in his)
- ``/itc give <player> <item>`` : Same than send but the item is not taken from your inventory

## Permissions

- ``itemtochat.reload`` : Lets you use the reload command
- ``itemtochat.send.click`` : Lets you display an item by middle clicking it
- ``itemtochat.send.chat`` : Lets you display an item by typing ``[item]`` (by default) in the chat
- ``insert here a node to send an item trough chat``
- ``insert here a node to give an item trough chat``
